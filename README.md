- Paper Abstract:
- People have been using readability formulas, or reading level formulas, for a wide variety of uses for many years. These formulas usually depend on factors like the number of characters, words, sentences, syllables per word, etc. there are in a sample of text. I created a formula which relies on the number of clauses in a sentence, which indicates the sentence complexity, as well as the vocabulary difficulty, which is based on the frequency of the words in modern English. In addition, I created a scale to go along with my formula so a user can see where their text falls with respect to other, more well-known texts.
